# ofxClipPCL

You can clip your mesh vertices by various geometries using CPU/GPU.

For CPU example, see example-gizmo.  
It depends also on [ofxImGui](https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui) and [ofxImGuizmo](https://github.com/nariakiiwatani/ofxImGuizmo).  

For GPU example, see example.  
I recommend using this with [ofxComposableShader](https://github.com/nariakiiwatani/ofxComposableShader).  
It makes it easy to combine multiple shader objects in one ofShader so you can write your shader code separated from clipping functionality.
